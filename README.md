A CLI that I use to select album covers for any albums in my iTunes library that don't currently have any artwork assosciated with them. Unfortunately, I haven't yet found a way to programmatically assosciate said images with said albums, so that still has to be done manually via iTunes. But at least this way I don't have to manually google for them. Saving clicks saves lives.
